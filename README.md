# WinTimeBackup - Time Machine for Windows

by Julian Gieseke (mail@juliangieseke.de)

based on "DeloreanCopy.bat" from ln.exe by Hermann Schinagel (Hermann.Schinagl@gmx.net)

This Script is provided AS IS!

The License from ln.exe applies also to this script.

# About this Script:
This script provides a simple implementation of a File History Snapshot like Backup using ln.exe. Its functionality is highly inspired by Apple Time Machine and Synology Time Backup/Hyper Backup. Like Time Backup and Time Machine, it uses a file based approach with hardlinks instead of a Database file like Hyper Backup and many other Backup Solutions do.

# Warning:
**This Script isnt tested very well yet and as it is my first Batchfile most of the code is very bad, so use at your own Risk and dont blame me if something goes wrong.**

# Changelog:

v 0.1 alpha (first working version)
- basic time machine like functionality provided
